## Hi there, I'm Dianyi ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a graduate of the London School of Economics and Political Science. At the LSE, I studied Political Science and Political Economy as an MSc student, and Politics and International Relations as a BSc student. Iâ€™m interested in fiscal-monetary interactions, public opinion and international conflicts. You can learn more about me at my [website](http://rubuky.com)!
